        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>Utah Valley Hiking. I chose this because I believe it it pretty straight forward and discriptive of the objective of this site.</p>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The site will be able to help people learn more about hiking here in Utah Valley. It will discribe what different trails are like, how long they are, and what sights you can find along the way. It will also advise people on what kind of things they may need on that hike.</p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>What hikes are good for beginners? What do I need to bring on my hikes? How long are certain hikes? What are at the end of different hikes?</p>
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>Earthy Green (#556B2F): Matches the forest's greenery and provides a grounded feel for buttons or headings.
            Soft Beige (#F5F5DC): A neutral background or accent color that pairs well with green and brown.
            Rich Brown (#8B4513): Reflects the tree trunks and adds warmth. Ideal for headers or navigation bars.
            Soft Gray (#D3D3D3): A versatile, neutral tone for text or backgrounds that ensures readability.</p>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>PARKINSANS!!! That is so funny, lol!
            https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Parkinsans</p>
        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>Honestly, if they require me to submit it I will just make one to match what I was able to complete, lol</p>
